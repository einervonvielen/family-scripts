# Scripts for family and friends

## faces

Tag you photos with your family members and friends.

This script collection searches your photos for faces and writes the names of your friends as tags into the side card files (xmp) of your photos or into the photos directly. As an intermediate step you sort the faces manually into directories ("known/Bob", "known/Jane",...)

Basically it mimics Googles Picasa except you have to use

- Linux
- the terminal to start several scripts
- the windows manager (nautilus, pcmanfm,...) as a user front end / graphical user interface

This is not what the average user expects but it does the job.

## scan

Convert scanned documents into PDFs where you can search for text.

Input
- PDFs
- TIFFs
- Series of TIFFs in the form of "scan-01.tiff", "scan-03.tiff",... (SimpleScan stores TIFFs like this.)

TIFFs as source produces better results than PDFs.

## fotodiary

Reads titles and descriptions from images and generates a web page.
