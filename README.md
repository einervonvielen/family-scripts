# Scripts for family and friends

## faces

Tag you photos with your family members and friends.

This script collection searches your photos for faces and writes the names of your friends as tags into the side card files (xmp) of your photos. As an intermediate step you sort the faces manually into directories ("known/Bob", "known/Jane",...)

## scan

Convert scanned documents into PDFs where you can search for text.

Input
- PDFs
